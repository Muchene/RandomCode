Implementation of a simple motion planner. The planner works by growing a tree in the following manner
Choses a random state in the state space, choose a random state in the tree, if 
we can make a motion from the tree state to the random state add the random state into the tree. With some
small probability we will sample the goal state and check whether we can make the transition. If we can, the solution
is found and we can backtrack to produce a path. This is a very dumb planner and is just meant to explore OMPL
