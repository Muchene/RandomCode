Main is in GeneralSearch.m

In there general A*, Breadth First Search, and Best-First Search are implemented. 

Astar_a.m - A* for a four connected space with manhattan distance as the heuristic. 
Astar_b.m  A* in a 4-connected space with euclidean distance as the heuristic.
Astar_c i A*  in an 8-connected space with manhattan distance as the heuristic. 
 
The priority queue code is from 'Matlab Central' since Matlab doesn't provide a nice PriorityQueue . The queue is 
an implementation based on priority queue described the CLS algorithms book.
